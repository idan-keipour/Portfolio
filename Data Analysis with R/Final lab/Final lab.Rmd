### Q0.Submission Instructions (Please read carefully)   



The exam will be submitted **individually** by uploading the solved exam `Rmd` and `html` files to the course `moodle`. 

Please name your files as `52414-HomeExam_ID.Rmd` and `52414-HomeExam_ID.html` where `ID` is replaced by your ID number (do **not** write your name in the file name or in the exam itself).

The number of points for each sub-question is indicated next to it, with $105$ points overall. The total grade will be at most $100$. 



Once you click on the `moodle` link for the home exam, the exam will start and you have three days (72 hours) to complete and submit it. 

The exam will be available from July 18th to July 30th. The last submission time is June 30th at 23:59. <br>

You may use all course materials, the web and other written materials and R libraries. 

You are NOT allowed to discuss any of the exam questions/materials with other students. 





**Analysis and Presentation of Results:**



Write your answers and explanations in the text of the `Rmd` file (*not* in the `code`). <br>

The text of your answers should be next to the relevant code, plots and tables and refer to them, and not at a separate place at the end. <br>

You need to explain every step of your analysis. When in doubt, a more detailed explanation is better than omitting explanations. 



Give informative titles, axis names and names for each curve/bar in your graphs. 

In some graphs you may need to change the graph limits. If you do so, please include the outlier points you have removed in a separate table.  <br>

Add informative comments explaining your code <br>



Whenever possible, use *objective* and *specific* terms and quantities learned in class, and avoid *subjective* and *general* unquantified statements. For example: <br>

`Good:` "We see a $2.5$-fold increase in the curve from Jan. 1st to March 1st". <br>

`Bad:` "The curve goes up at the beginning". <br>

`Good:` "The median is $4.7$. We detected five outliers with distance $>3$ standard deviations from the median". <br>

`Bad:` "The five points on the sides seem far from the middle". 



Sometimes `Tables` are the best way to present your results (e.g. when asked for a list of items). Exclude irrelevant

rows/columns. Display clearly items' names in your `Tables`.



Show numbers in plots/tables using standard digits and not scientific display. 

That is: 90000000 and not 9e+06.  

Round numbers to at most 3 digits after the dot - that is, 9.456 and not 9.45581451044



Some questions may require data wrangling and manipulation which you need to 

decide on. The instructions may not specify precisely the exact plot you should use

(for example: `show the distribution of ...`). In such cases, you should decide what and how to show the results. 



When analyzing real data, use your best judgment if you encounter missing values, negative values, NaNs, errors in the data etc. (e.g. excluding them, zeroing negative values..) and mention what you have done in your analysis in such cases. 



Required libraries are called in the `Rmd` file. Install any library missing from your `R` environment. You are allowed to add additional libraries if you want. 

If you do so, *please add them at the start of the Rmd file, right below the existing libraries, and explain what libraries you've added, and what is each new library used for*.

## Q1. Two Armies Simulation (45 pt)    

<img src="https://images.freeimages.com/images/premium/previews/1923/19232816-toy-soldiers-war-concepts.jpg" alt="soldiers" width="300"/>



Consider two armies of $10$ `R` loving statisticians and $10$ `Python` loving statisticians, facing each other in a shootout, fighting to the death over which language is better. 



Once the battle starts, assume that each statistician tries to shoot as fast as she can, where the time until shooting has an exponential distribution with $\lambda=1$. After a shot is fired, the statistician keeps firing, with the time to the next shot again distributed as $exp(1)$. Each statistician keeps shooting until she is shot and killed herself by a statistician from the opposing army, and leaves the battle. The times until shooting the next bullet for all statisticians and all shots are independent. <br>

At each shot, the statistician chooses as target **uniformly at random** a member from the remaining **living members** of the opposing army. 

<br>

The battle keeps going until all persons from one of the armies die, and then the other army is declared the `winner`. 

Let $X$ be the number of remaining statisticians from the `winner` army when the battle ends. <br>

Throughout this question, assume that statisticians are **perfect shooters**, and always hit their target (the choice of the target changes however between different sub-questions below).





a. (5pt) Describe in words a simulation strategy to estimate $E[X]$ and $Var(X)$, including how would you simulate a battle between the two armies. <br>

**Hint:** remember that the exponential distribution has a memoryless property: $Pr(T>t) = Pr(T > t+s | T>s)$, $\forall t, s > 0$. <br>

You can perform the simulations in this question exactly as described, which may take many minutes to run, or perform **simpler** and **faster** simulations using probabilistic arguments, provided that they are **equivalent** to the description in the question. <br>

(For example, if you were requested to simulate $n$ i.i.d. $Bernouli(p)$ random variables and report their sum, you could argue that instead it is enough to simulate a single $Bionomial(n,p)$ random variable).





b. (8pt) Simulate $1,000$ random battles as described in the question and use them to estimate $E[X]$ and $Var(X)$ from the random simulations.  <br>

It is recommended to write a function for the simulation and call it, such that the simulation function can be used also in the subsequent sub-questions. 





c. (8pt) Now, change $n$, the number of statisticians in each army, to be $n=10, 20, 40, ..., 10240$ (each time multiplying $n$ by two), and let $X_n$ be the random variable counting the number of remaining winners when starting with $n$ statisticians in each army. (so the variable $X$ from (a.) corresponds to $X_{10}$). <br>

For each value of $n$ simulate $100$ random battles and estimate $\mu_n \equiv E[X_n]$. 

Plot your estimate vs. $n$. <br>

Find a simple function $f(n)$ such that it holds that $\mu_n \approx f(n)$ based on the plot. 

(**Hint:** you can use log-scale). 





d. (8pt) In this sub-question, assume that all statisticians in both armies have used their programming language too much so they became to hate it, and therefore in each shot they aim and kill a random member from their **own** army (including possibly themselves). <br>

Modify the simulation to accommodate this case, and repeat the simulation, plot and finding a function $f(n)$ as in (c.) for this case. <br>

Explain in words the differences in results between the two cases. 





e. (8pt) In this sub-question, assume that all statisticians in both armies are **completely drunk**, and shoot randomly one of the **remaining persons alive** (from both armies) including themselves (they still always hit their target).  

Repeat (d.) for this case. Are the results similar or different? why? 





f. (8pt) Finally, suppose in this sub-question that statisticians that are shot become zombies instead of being killed, and can still keep shooting at statisticians from the opposing army (as in (a.), (b.)). <br>

All statisticians aim at and hit a random **living** (non-zombie) member from the opposing army. The battle ends when all members of a certain army become zombies, and then $X_n$ records the number of remaining living (non-zombie) statisticians in the other army. <br>

Repeat the simulation, plot and finding a function $f(n)$ as in (c.) for this case. <br>

Explain in words the differences in results between the this and the previous cases. 





**Solutions:**

## Q1
### 1.a
To perform a battle simulation I will create two vectors in length 10  with each element drawn from an exponential distribution exp(1).
The statistician for whom the value is minimal shoots first. Now for the statistician who shoots, I will random number (uniformly) between 1 to 10 (for the next iterations it will be 1 to the number of living statisticians in the second group) who will pronounce the statistician in the second group he shoots at. I will remove the statistician that got shot, and since for each statistician the shooting rate is independent, we will random another element from an exponential distribution. The new element for the shooter will be the summarize of his two elements. In the next step I will repeat the process again with the next shooter being the shooter whose pace is the fastest (in case he stays alive of course).
I will repeat this process until all the statisticians of one of the groups dies.
to find E[X] and var[X] I will keep the value of X at each simulation in a vector.
E[X] will be the the mean of the vector and the variance will be the variance of the vector. I can also calculate the varience using the formula : Var[X] = E[X^2]-(E[X])^2.

### 1.b
```{r}
func = function(n){
  first_team <- rexp(n)
  second_team <- rexp(n)
  while ((length(first_team)>0)&(length(second_team)>0)){
    if (min(first_team) < min(second_team)){
      shoot <- floor(runif(n=1,min=1,max=length(second_team)+1))
      second_team <- second_team[-c(shoot)]
      fastest <- which.min(first_team)
      first_team[fastest] <- first_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
    else{
      shoot <- floor(runif(n=1,min=1,max=length(first_team)+1))
      first_team <- first_team[-c(shoot)]
      fastest <- which.min(second_team)
      second_team[fastest] <- second_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
  }
  if(length(first_team) > 0){
    return(length(first_team))}
  else{
    return(length(second_team))
  }
}

sim <- c()
for(i in seq(10^3)){
  sim[i] <- func(10)
}
expectation <- mean(sim)
variance <- var(sim)
expectation
variance
```

We can see that E[X] is worth about 5.7 and the variance is worth about 5.

### 1.c
```{r}
n_stats <- c(10)
for(i in seq(2,11)){
  n_stats[i] <- n_stats[i-1]*2
}

temp <- c()
EX_n <- c()
for( k in seq(11)){
  for( j in seq(100)){
    temp[j] <- func(n_stats[k])}
  EX_n[k] <- mean(temp)
}

plot(n_stats,EX_n,xlab = "Number of statisticians in each group", ylab = "E[X]",main = "1.c  E[x] against statisticians",col = 'blue')
lm1 <- lm(log(EX_n)~ log(n_stats))
plot(log(n_stats),log(EX_n),col = "blue",xlab = "log of number of statisticians in each group",ylab = "log of E[X]",abline(lm1),main = "1.c  log of E[x] against log of statisticians")

lm1$coefficients

```

The function that best explains the plots is log(E[x]) ≈ 0.75*log(n) + 0.05

### 1.d
```{r}
funcd = function(n){
  first_team <- rexp(n)
  second_team <- rexp(n)
  while ((length(first_team)>0)&(length(second_team)>0)){
    if (min(first_team) < min(second_team)){
      shoot <- floor(runif(n=1,min=1,max=length(first_team)+1))
      first_team <- first_team[-c(shoot)]
      fastest <- which.min(first_team)
      first_team[fastest] <- first_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
    else{
      shoot <- floor(runif(n=1,min=1,max=length(second_team)+1))
      second_team <- second_team[-c(shoot)]
      fastest <- which.min(second_team)
      second_team[fastest] <- second_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
  }
  if(length(first_team) > 0){
    return(length(first_team))}
  else{
    return(length(second_team))
  }
}

temp_d <- c()
EX_n_d <- c()
for( k in seq(11)){
  for( j in seq(100)){
    temp_d[j] <- funcd(n_stats[k])}
  EX_n_d[k] <- mean(temp_d)
}

plot(n_stats,EX_n_d,xlab = "Number of statisticians in each group", ylab = "E[X]",main = "1.d  E[x] against number of statisticians",col = 'green')
lm2 <- lm(log(EX_n_d)~ log(n_stats))
plot(log(n_stats),log(EX_n_d),col = "blue",xlab = "log of number of statisticians in each group",ylab = "log of E[X]",abline(lm2),main = "1.d log of E[x] against log of statisticians")

```


It can be seen that in this case it is not possible to find a function f(n) that will well express the relationship between the number of statisticians and the expectation of X. When the statisticians in each group shoot only on someone in his oun group then the amount of statisticians left in the winning group is random. In the first game the amount of statisticians in each team is affected by the amount of statisticians left in the second team, but in the current situation they do not affect each other.



### 1.e
```{r}
funce = function(n){
  first_team <- rexp(n)
  second_team <- rexp(n)
  while ((length(first_team)>0)&(length(second_team)>0)){
    if (min(first_team) < min(second_team)){
      fastest <- which.min(first_team)
      first_team[fastest] <- first_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
    else{
      fastest <- which.min(second_team)
      second_team[fastest] <- second_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
    shoot <- floor(runif(n=1,min=1,max=length(first_team)+length(second_team)+1))
    if(shoot > length(first_team)){   #in this case we want to shoot someone from the second group
      shoot <- shoot-length(first_team)
      second_team <- second_team[-c(shoot)]
    }
    else{
      first_team <- first_team[-c(shoot)]
    }
  }
  if(length(first_team) > 0){
    return(length(first_team))}
  else{
    return(length(second_team))
  }
}
    
temp_e <- c()
EX_n_e <- c()
for( k in seq(11)){
  for( j in seq(100)){
    temp_e[j] <- funce(n_stats[k])}
  EX_n_e[k] <- mean(temp_e)
}

plot(n_stats,EX_n_e,xlab = "Number of statisticians in each group", ylab = "E[X]",main = "1.e  E[x] against number of statisticians",col = 'green')
lm2 <- lm(log(EX_n_e)~ log(n_stats))
plot(log(n_stats),log(EX_n_e),col = "blue",xlab = "log of number of statisticians in each group",ylab = "log of E[X]",abline(lm2),main = "1.e  log of E[x] against log of statisticians")

```

In this case the results are similar to the case in the previous section (d). This is because, as in the previous case, the number of statisticians left in the second group does not affect the number of statisticians in the current group. The player who shoots can shoot both players from his team and the other team equally and thus the number of players remaining in the winning team becomes random in relation to the original number of statisticians in each team.


### 1.f
```{r}
funcf = function(n){
  first_team <- rexp(n)
  second_team <- rexp(n)
  living_1 <- n
  living_2 <- n
  while ((living_1>0)&(living_2>0)){
    if (min(first_team) < min(second_team)){
      living_2 <- living_2 -1
      fastest <- which.min(first_team)
      first_team[fastest] <- first_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
    else{
      living_1 <- living_1 -1
      fastest <- which.min(second_team)
      second_team[fastest] <- second_team[fastest]+rexp(1)
    }
  }
  if(living_1 > 0){
    return(living_1)}
  else{
    return(living_2)
  }
}

temp_f <- c()
EX_n_f <- c()
for( k in seq(11)){
  for( j in seq(10)){
    temp_f[j] <- funcf(n_stats[k])}
  EX_n_f[k] <- mean(temp_f)
}

plot(n_stats,EX_n_f,xlab = "Number of statisticians in each group", ylab = "E[X]",main = "1.f  E[x] against number of statisticians",col = 'green')
lm2 <- lm(log(EX_n_f)~ log(n_stats))
plot(log(n_stats),log(EX_n_f),col = "blue",xlab = "log of number of statisticians in each group",ylab = "log of E[X]",abline(lm2),main = "1.f  log of E[x] against log of statisticians")

```

In this case we see that when making a transformation (log) there is a relatively linear relationship between the variables. The difference is that now the dead statisticians are not out of the game, meaning they can shoot at the statisticians living in the second group. Unlike previous examples the zombies only shoot at the players in the second group so here there is a connection between the number of statisticians and the expectation of X.


## Q2. Analysis and Visualization of Twitter Data (60 pt)    



<img src="https://cdn-0.therandomvibez.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jokes-On-New-Years-Resolution.jpg" alt="resolutions" width="300"/>





a. (4pt) Download and read the tweets dataset file `New-years-resolutions-DFE.csv` available [here](https://github.com/DataScienceHU/DataAnalysisR_2021/blob/master/New-years-resolutions-DFE.csv). 

The data represents new year's resolutions tweets by American users wishing to change something in their life at the start of the year $2015$, downloaded from [here](https://data.world/crowdflower/2015-new-years-resolutions#). <br>

Make sure that the tweets `text` column has `character` type. 

Show the top and bottom two rows of the resulting data-frame. 





b. (5pt) The class `times` from the library `chron` stores and displays times in the above format `Hours:Minutes:Seconds`, but also treats them as numeric values between zero and one in units of days. For example, the time `10:48:00` corresponds to the value: $(10 + 48/60)/24 = 0.45$. <br>

Create a new column with tweet times, of class `times`, with the time of the day for each tweet, in the above format. For example, the first entry in the column corresponding to the time of the first tweet should be: `10:48:00`. <br>

Make a histogram showing the number of tweets in every hour of the $24$ hours in a day (that is, the bins are times between `00:00` and `00:59`, between `01:00` and `01:59` etc.). <br>

At which hours do we see the most/fewest tweets?





c. (6pt) Plot the distribution of tweets `text` lengths (in characters) made by `females` and `males` separately. Who writes longer tweets? <br>

Repeat, but this time plot the tweets lengths distribution for tweets in the four different regions of the US

(`Midwest`, `Northeast`, `South` and `West`). Report the major differences in lengths between regions. <br>

Finally, show the tweets lengths distribution for tweets for the $10$ different categories given in `Resolution_Category`. Report the major differences in lengths between categories. 





d. (8pt) Compute the number of occurrences of each word in the `text` of all the tweets. Ignore upper/lower case differences. <br>

Remove all common stop words (use the command `stop_words` from the tidytext package). <br>

Remove words containing the special characters: `#`, `@`, `&`, `-`, `.`, `:` and `?`. <br>

Remove also non-informative words: `resolution`, `rt`, `2015` and the empty word. <br>

Plot the top $100$ remaining words in a word cloud, using the `wordcloud2` package. <br>





e. (8pt) Find for each of the top (most frequent) $100$ words from 2.(d.) and each of the $10$ tweet categories, the fraction of tweets from this category where the word appears, and list them in a $100 \times 10$ table $F$, with $f_{ij}$ indicating the frequency of word $i$ in category $j$. <br>

That is, if for example there were $200$ tweets in the category `Humor`, and $30$ of them contained the word `joke`, then the frequency was $0.15$. <br>

Finally, for each of the $10$ categories we want to find the most `characteristic` words, i.e. words appearing more frequently in this category compared to other categories: <br>

Formally, compute for each word $i$ and each category $j$ the difference between the frequency in the category and the maximum over frequencies in other categories: $d_{ij} = f_{ij} - \max_{k \neq j} f_{ik}$.

(For example, if the word `joke` had frequency $0.15$ in `Humor`, and the next highest frequency for this word in other categories is $0.1$, then the difference for this word is $0.05$).

Find for each category $j$ of the $10$ categories the $3$ `characteristic` words with the highest differences $d_{ij}$. Show a table with the $10$ categories and the $3$ `characteristic` words you have found for each of them. Do the words make sense for the categories? 





f. (5pt) Plot the number of tweets in each of the $10$ categories shown in `Resolution_Category`. <br>

Next, compute and show in a table of size $10 \times 4$ the number of tweets for each of the $10$ categories from users in each of the four regions of the USA: `Midwest`, `Northeast`, `South` and `West`. 







g. (8pt) We want to test the null hypothesis that users in different `regions`  have the same distribution over `categories` for their resolutions, using the Pearson chi-square statistic: 

$$

S = \sum_{i=1}^{10} \sum_{j=1}^{4} \frac{(o_{ij}-e_{ij})^2}{e_{ij}}

$$

where $o_{ij}$ is the number of tweets on category $i$ from region $j$ computed in the table in the previous sub-question, assuming some indexing for the categories and regions (for example, $j=1,2,3,4$ for `Midwest`, `Northeast`, `South` and `West`, respectively, and similarly for the categories). The expected counts $e_{ij}$ are given by: 

$$

e_{ij} = \frac{o_{ \bullet j} o_{i \bullet}  }  {o_{\bullet \bullet}}

$$

where $o_{i \bullet}$ is the sum over the $i$'th row (over all regions), $o_{\bullet j}$  the sum over the $j$'th column (over all categories) and $o_{\bullet \bullet}$ the sum over all observations in the table. These expected counts correspond to independence between the row (categories) and column (regions) according to the null hypothesis. <br>

Compute and report the test statistic for the table computed in 2.(f). <br>

Use the approximation $S \sim \chi^2(27)$ to compute a p-value for the above test (there are $(4-1) \times (10-1) = 27$ degrees of freedom). Would you reject the null hypothesis? <br>

Finally, repeat the analysis (computing a table, $\chi^2$-statistic and p-value) but this time split tweets by `gender` (`male` and `female`) instead of by `region`, to get a $10 \times 2$ table. Is there a significant difference in the distribution of categories between males and females?





h. (8pt) Use the following simulation to create a randomized dataset of `(category, region)` pairs for the tweets: <br>

For each tweet in the dataset keep the real `category` (from the column `Resolution_Category`) but change the `region` randomly by shuffling (permuting) the regions column in a random order, such that the total number of tweets from each region remains the same. <br>

Repeat this simulation $N=1,000$ times, each time creating a new shuffled random data, with the `category` column remaining the same and the `region` column shuffled each time in a random order. 

For each such simulation indexed $i$ compute the `category`-by-`region` occurance table and the resulting $\chi^2$ test statistic from 2.(g.) and call it $S_i$. <br>

Plot the empirical density distribution of the $S_i$ randomized test statistics and compare it to the theoretical density of the $\chi^2(27)$ distribution. Are the distributions similar? <br>

Finally, compute the empirical p-value, comparing the test statistic $S$ computed on the real data in 2.(g.) to the $1,000$ random statistics:  

$$

\widehat{Pval} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N 1_{\{S_i \geq S\}}.

$$

How different from the p-value obtained via the chi-square approximation? 





i. (8pt) Compute for each of the $50$ states (and `DC` - District of Columbia) in the US the number of tweets made by users from this state. <br>

Next, load the `usmap` library that contains the variable `statepop`. <br>

Use this variable to compute the number of tweets per million residents for each state. <br>

Remove `DC` and use the `usmap` package to make a map of USA states, where each state is colored by the number of tweets per million residents. <br>

Report the three states with the maximal and minimal number.

## Q1
### 2.a

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/idank/OneDrive/R/Data Analysis with R/final_exam")
df <- read.csv("New-years-resolutions-DFE.csv")
class(df$text)
```

We can see that the Class of "text" is character.

The top two rows are: 

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(df,2))

```

The bottom two rows are: 

```{r}
knitr::kable(tail(df,2))
```


### 2.b
```{r}

df$tweet_times <- as.chron(df$tweet_created , "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")
df$tweet_times <- format(df$tweet_times, format = "%H:%M:%S") 
df$tweet_times <- as.times(df$tweet_times ) 
hist(hours(df$tweet_times),breaks = 24,col = "purple",xlim=c(0,25),main = "Number of tweets by hours",xlab = "Hour")

```

As we see the hours when the highest number of tweets are written are between 9:00-10:00 and 12:00-13:00. The fewest tweets are between 2:00-3:00.

### 2.c

```{r}
df$tweets_lengths <- nchar(df$text,type = "chars")
ggplot(data = df,aes(x= tweets_lengths)) + geom_density(aes(col= factor(gender)))+ylab("Density")+labs(title="Tweet lengths density")+theme_grey()
```

As we see women writes longer tweets than men. For high tweet lengths the distribution of women is higher, and for low tweet lengths the distribution of men is higher.

```{r}

ggplot(data = df,aes(x= tweets_lengths)) + geom_density(aes(col= factor(tweet_region)))+ylab("Density")+labs(title="Tweet length density")+theme_grey()

```

We can see that the distribution of the length of the tweets is relatively similar for all regions, except Midwest where the distribution of the length of the tweets is slightly lower than the rest.

```{r}
ggplot(data = df,aes(x= tweets_lengths)) + geom_density(aes(col= factor(Resolution_Category)))+ylab("Density")+labs(title="Tweet length density")+theme_grey()
```

In this case I will use Boxplot since the distribution is uninformative:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df,aes(x=tweets_lengths)) + geom_boxplot(aes(col= factor(Resolution_Category)))+
  xlab("Tweet length") + ylab("Tweet category") + labs(title="Tweet length BoxPlot") + theme_grey()

```

It is now easy to see that in the "philanthropic" category the tweets are the longest. In addition to the topic of "humor" the tweets are the shortest on average.

### 2.d
First I will clean the data and then I'll make the WordCloud:

```{r}
wc <- sort(table(unlist(strsplit(tolower(df$text), " "))), decreasing = TRUE)
clean <- setNames(data.frame(wc), c("word", "count"))  %>%  anti_join(stop_words, by = "word")
clean <- clean[!str_detect(pattern = "#|@|&|-|\\.|\\?|\\!|:|\\s|\\d|2015|rt|resolution", string = clean$word),]
clean$word <- str_replace_all(clean$word,"[^[:alnum:]]", "") #Unwanted marks still remain so we  remove them
clean <- clean %>% filter(!clean$word %in% c("")) #Remove empty rows

wordcloud2(data=clean[1:100,] , size = 1, shape = 'diamond', gridSize=10 )

```

We can see the WordCloud created by the most common words in all of the tweets.

### 2.e
At first I will set the 10X100 matrix. Then to complete the table I will calculate for each category in how many tweets it appears. This calculation will help us find the denominator of each limb in the matrix. To calculate the numerator I will go through all the categories and for each category I will go through all the words and all the tweets. If the tweet both contains the word and belongs to the given category - we would like to count the tweet. Finally for each combination of category and word in the list we will calculate the ratio between the amount of tweets in the category that contain the word and the tweets in the category that do not contain the word

```{r}
d.frequency <- data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow =100, ncol = 10))
count_cat <- df %>% group_by(Resolution_Category) %>% summarise(number = n()) #Count the amount of tweets in each category
rownames(d.frequency) <- (clean$word[1:100])
colnames(d.frequency) <- (count_cat$Resolution_Category)
for(colums in 1:10){
  for(rows in 1:100){
    c <- 0
    for(index in 1:5011){
      if ((grepl(row.names(d.frequency)[rows], df[index,7], fixed = TRUE)) & (df[index,5] == colnames(d.frequency)[colums])){
        c <- c+1
      }
    }
    d.frequency[rows,colums] <- c/count_cat[colums,2]
  }
}
difs <- d.frequency
for (i in 1:100){
  for(j in 1:10){
    difs[i,j] <- difs[i,j] - max(difs[i,-j])
  }
}
common <- data.frame(matrix(NA, nrow =3, ncol = 10))
colnames(common) <- (count_cat$Resolution_Category)
for (cat in 1:10) {
  common[,cat] <- rownames(top_n(difs,3, difs[cat])[cat])
}
knitr::kable(common)
```

We can see that there is a lot of sense  in the words that characterize each category. For example, the words job and goal are common in the "career" category. Under the category of "Education" the words family and friends appear. Another example is in "Health & Fitness" category where the words eat,gym and fit appears. In the "Finance" category the words are money,spend and more. there are more examples in the other categories so we can see that it makes sense.

### 2.f
```{r}
ggplot(count_cat, aes(x=Resolution_Category, y=number)) + theme_grey()+
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.8,fill = "blue", stat = "identity",bins = 10)+theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 50, hjust = 1)) + labs(title="f. Number of tweets by categories")+ xlab("category")+ylab("number of tweets")


t <- table(df$Resolution_Category,df$tweet_region)
knitr::kable(t)
```

In the table we can see the number of tweets for each of the 10 categories from users in each of the four regions of the USA. 
The histogram shows the number of tweets in each of the 10 categories.


### 2.g

```{r}
tests <- chisq.test(t)
tests
```

I will reject H0 if P-val < alpha. The p-value I get is 0.4984 and therefor for most cases (unless alpha is very high) I won't reject H0. that means that users in different regions have the same distribution over categories for their resolutions.


When we split the tweets by gender instead of region the table looks like this:
```{r}
t_gender <- table(df$Resolution_Category,df$gender)
knitr::kable(t_gender)
```

In this case the chisquere test is :
```{r}
chisq.test(t_gender)
```

We see than in this case p_value ≈ 0 and there for we will reject H0 in almost all of the cases.
that means that there is a significant difference in the distribution between males and females.


### 2.h
To perform the simulation I will create a function that takes the original data frame and switches between the region of the tweets. The output of the function is the test statistic we saw in the previous sections (towards the muggle data frame). 
In the function I will keep the original regions as vector and after pulling out a region I will remove it from the vector. This way the number of tweets in each region will remain the same.

```{r}
shuffle <- function(){
  regions <- df$tweet_region 
  copy <- df
  for(i in seq(length(rownames(df)))){
    r <- rdunif(1,1,length(regions))
    copy[i,15] <- regions[r]
    regions <- regions[-r] 
  }
  t_random <- table(copy$Resolution_Category,copy$tweet_region)
  return(chisq.test(t_random)$statistic)
}
```

Now, using the function I can simulate and plot the empirical density distribution of the  randomized test statistics:

```{r}
sims <- c()
for (j in seq(1000)) {
  sims[j] <- shuffle()
}

ggplot(data = as.data.frame(sims),aes(x=sims))+
  geom_density(fill="blue",alpha=0.2)+  theme_grey() +stat_function(fun = dchisq, args = list(df = 27),col='red')+labs(title="h. Theoretical distribution versus simulation")

```

We can see that the distribution I get is very similar to the theoretical density of the χ2(27) distribution. 
Apparently if we were to perform a higher number of simulations it would approach an even more theoretical distribution. 

Now I will calculate the P-value:

```{r}
counter <- 0
for (sim in sims){
  if (sim >= tests$statistic){
    counter <- counter+1
  }
}

print(counter/1000)

```

we can see that the P-value ≈ 0.5


### 2.i
```{r}
library(usmap)
count_states <- count(df,tweet_state)
pop <- usmap::statepop
pop$per_milion <- (pop$pop_2015)/(10^6)
colnames(count_states) <- c("abbr","n")
full_data <- full_join(count_states, pop, by = "abbr")
full_data$tweets_per_mil <- full_data$n / full_data$per_milion
full_data <- full_data[-8,]
p <- plot_usmap(data = full_data, values = "tweets_per_mil",color="green",labels = T,label_color = "red")+scale_fill_continuous("Tweets per million")+labs(title="i. Heatmap of tweets per million")+ theme(legend.position = "right")
p$layers[[2]]$aes_params$size <- 2.5
p
```

The top three states with the maximal number of tweets per million are:
```{r}
top <- full_data %>% arrange(desc(tweets_per_mil))
knitr::kable(head(top$full,3))
```

The three states with the minimum number of tweets per million are:

```{r}
bottom <- full_data %>% arrange((tweets_per_mil))
knitr::kable(head(bottom$full,3))

```
